This is a repo for my github profile README.md.

Within my README.md I'd like to keep an updated list of projects under the `Current Projects` section.  I provide the list of projects urls that I'd like you to help me keep updated.

Here is a short example of what I'd like the section to look like...

### Current Projects

* 🔭 __[VibeTTY](https://github.com/johnrobinsn/VibeTTY)__ - An optimized open-source SSH client for agentic mobile coding.
* 🔭 __[claude-watch](https://github.com/johnrobinsn/claude-watch)__ - A terminal UI dashboard for monitoring multiple Claude Code sessions in tmux

So whenever I ask you to update my projects.  I'd like to go through this following list of URLs in order and regenerate the `Current Projects` section.  A few other things that I'd like you to do choose a representitive emoticon for each project and if the project is on github retrieve the project name and description from github.com.  If the url is not a github url see if you can come up with a good title and description from the linked page.

Here is the project list of URLs
